ETL Job with AWS Glue Studio, S3, & Athena üöÄ
Background
This repository serves as a guide to creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) job using a combination of AWS Cloud Services, namely Amazon S3, AWS Glue Studio, and Amazon Athena. ETL is a crucial process in handling large volumes of analytical data, ensuring it is transformed and loaded into a format suitable for analysis and business insights.

Overview
The ETL job in this project follows these main steps:

Extraction: Data is extracted from its original storage location, typically residing in various sources across the enterprise.

Transformation: The extracted data undergoes transformation to fit a standardized format. This often includes cleaning, deduplication, and other necessary operations.

Loading: Transformed data is loaded into the target destination source, making it accessible for analysis and reporting.

AWS Cloud Services Used
1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) üóÑÔ∏è
Amazon S3 is utilized for intermediary data storage during the ETL process. It provides a scalable and durable storage solution, ensuring data is securely stored and easily accessible.

2. AWS Glue Studio üõ†Ô∏è
AWS Glue Studio serves as the main engine for our ETL job. It provides a visual interface for designing, scheduling, and running ETL jobs. The platform simplifies the ETL process, making it more accessible to users with varying technical expertise.

3. Amazon Athena üìä
Amazon Athena is employed as the query tool, allowing users to interactively analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL queries. Athena seamlessly integrates with the ETL pipeline, enabling efficient querying of the loaded data.

Getting Started
To replicate this ETL job in your AWS environment, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine or fork it to your GitHub account.

Set Up AWS Resources: Ensure you have the necessary AWS accounts and permissions. Set up Amazon S3 buckets, configure AWS Glue Studio, and create an Athena database.

Configure AWS Glue Studio Job: Open the AWS Glue Studio job in the repository and customize it according to your data sources, transformation logic, and target destination.

Run the ETL Job: Execute the AWS Glue Studio job to perform the ETL process.

Query Data with Athena: Use Amazon Athena to run SQL queries on the loaded data in Amazon S3.
